## Definition:

Is similar to factorial of a number, In primorial, not all the natural numbers get multiplied, only prime numbers are multiplied to calculate the primorial of a number. It's denoted with P<sub>#</sub> and it is the product of the first n prime numbers.

## Task:

- Given a number N, calculate its primorial.
- Only positive numbers will be passed (N > 0).

## Examples:

```javascript
1- numPrimorial (3) ==> return (30)
```
Explanation:

Since the passed number is (3) ,Then the primorial should obtained by multiplying 2 * 3 * 5 = 30.
Mathematically written as, P<sub>3#</sub> = 30.

```javascript
2- numPrimorial (5) ==> return (2310)
```

Explanation:

Since the passed number is (5) ,Then the primorial should obtained by multiplying 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 = 2310.
Mathematically written as, P<sub>5#</sub> = 2310.

```javascript
3- numPrimorial (6) ==> return (30030)
```

Explanation:

Since the passed number is (6) ,Then the primorial should obtained by multiplying 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 = 30030.
Mathematically written as, P<sub>6#</sub> = 30030.
